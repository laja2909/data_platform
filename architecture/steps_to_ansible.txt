1. log to host
vagrant ssh host
2. cd to architecture folder
cd /opt/data_platform/architecture
3. create ansible folder
mkdir ansible
4. cd to ansible folder
cd ansible
5. create inventory file (defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate)
nano inventory
6. create ansible config file (for using this we can create more nicer looking commands (no need to define ssh key path etc.))
nano ansible.cfg
